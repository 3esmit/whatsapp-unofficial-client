##### Why? 

I have found [this really cool project](https://github.com/haskellcamargo/skype-unofficial-client), so I decided to do the same for wpp.

##### Installation

WhatsApp Unofficial Client is currently available for Linux x86 and x64 and
unix-based systems.

`git clone https://github.com/Kuchiriel/whatsapp-unofficial-client`

`sudo make linux_x86` or `sudo make linux_x64`

Run the application by `/opt/whatsapp_unofficial_client/whatsapp` or through
searching for "WhatsApp" in the main menu.
